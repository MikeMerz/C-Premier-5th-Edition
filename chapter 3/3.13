Exercise 3.13: How many elements are there in each of the following
vectors? What are the values of the elements?
(a) vector<int> v1;
(b) vector<int> v2(10);
(c) vector<int> v3(10, 42);
(d) vector<int> v4{10};
(e) vector<int> v5{10, 42};
(f) vector<string> v6{10};
(g) vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};

Answer:
a)v1 is an empty vector.
b)v2 is a vector that hold 10 elements whose value is 0.
c)v3 is a vector that hold 10 elements whose value is 42.
d)v4 is a vector that hold 1 element whose value is 10.
e)v5 is a vector that hold 2 elements whose value is 10 and 42.
f)v6 is a vector that hold 10 elements whose value is an empty string.
g)v7 is a vector that hold 10 elements whose value is "hi".
