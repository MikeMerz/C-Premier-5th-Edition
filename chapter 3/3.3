Exercise 3.3: Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string
input operator and in the getline function.

Answer:
The string input operator reads characters until it encounters a whitespace so the string returned will be without whitespaces
while the getline function reads characters until it encounters a new line and thus returns the string with the whitespaces.
