Exercise 3.30: Identify the indexing errors in the following code:


constexpr size_t array_size = 10;
int ia[array_size];
for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
ia[ix] = ix;

Answer:
The first error is that we don't access the first element in the array which is located at index 0, and on the last iteration of the for loop
we will access memory that is outside the range of the array.
