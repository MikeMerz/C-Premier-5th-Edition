Exercise 3.27: Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments
and returns an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal?
Explain why.
unsigned buf_size = 1024;
(a) int ia[buf_size];
(b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14];
(c) int ia[txt_size()];
(d) char st[11] = "fundamental";

Answer:
a -> Illegal since buf_size is not a constant expression.
b -> Legal
c -> Illegal since txt_size will return it's value during run time so it is not a constant expression.
d -> Illegal since the literal has 12 chars, 11 for the word and 1 for the null terminator so st has to be at least of size 12.
