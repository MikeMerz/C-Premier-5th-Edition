Exercise 3.12: Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in
error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those
that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.
(a) vector<vector<int>> ivec;
(b) vector<string> svec = ivec;
(c) vector<string> svec(10, "null");

Anwser:
a)Definition is legal, the definition creates a vector of vectors of type int.
b)Definition is illegal, the definition tries to copy the elements of ivec which are vectors of type int to a vector of type string.
c)Definition is legal, the definition will create a vector of 10 strings whose values are "null".
