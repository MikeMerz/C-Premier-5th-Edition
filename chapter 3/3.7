/*Exercise 3.7: What would happen if you define the loop control variable in
the previous exercise as type char? Predict the results and then change your
program to use a char to see if you were right.*/

Answer:
Changing to char won't have any effect on the results since a string is sequence of chars when using auto the loop variable will be of type char.
