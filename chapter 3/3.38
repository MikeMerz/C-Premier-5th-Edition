Exercise 3.38: In this section, we noted that it was not only illegal but
meaningless to try to add two pointers. Why would adding two pointers be
meaningless?

Answer:
Pointers hold an address this is why adding two pointers will cause us to add their respective address and we could reach an unknown area in memory and we won't be able
to know what the pointer points to.
