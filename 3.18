Exercise 3.18: Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?

vector<int> ivec;
ivec[0] = 42;

Answer:
The program is illegal since ivec is an empty vector and trying to subscript will cause an undefined behaviour and cause a major security threat.
The program can be fixed by changin the first line to vector<int> ivec{1} and thus creating a single sized vector.
