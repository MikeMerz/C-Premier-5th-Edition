Exercise 2.36: In the following code, determine the type of each variable
and the value each variable has when the code finishes:

int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype((b)) d = a;
++c;
++d;

Answer:
a is of type int with value of 4.
b is of type int with value of 4.
c is of type int with value of 4.
d is of type int& with value of 4.

Exercise 2.37: Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a
reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand.
That is, if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using
that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:

int a = 3, b = 4;
decltype(a) c = a;
decltype(a = b) d = a;

Answer:
a is of type int with value of 3.
b is of type int with value of 4.
c is of type int with value of 3.
d is of type int& with value of 3.

Exercise 2.38: Describe the differences in type deduction between
decltype and auto. Give an example of an expression where auto and
decltype will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce
differing types

Answer:
decltype and auto handle top-level const differently, auto ignores top-level const while decltype will include them and thus the deduction of each may differ
another diffrence is that deduction of decltype depends on the form of the expression, for example each set of parentheses changes the type.
