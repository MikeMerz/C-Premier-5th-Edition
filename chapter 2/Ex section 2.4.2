Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why.
(a) int i = -1, &r = 0;
(b) int *const p2 = &i2;
(c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;
(d) const int *const p3 = &i2;
(e) const int *p1 = &i2;
(f) const int &const r2;
(g) const int i2 = i, &r = i


a)Initialization not legal.
b)Legal initialization if i2 is of type int since p2 is a const pointer to int the whole expression is legal and
we won't be able to change the address that p2 points to.
c)Legal initialization since r is a const refrence we will not be able to change the value of the object it binds to.
d)Legal initialization
e)Initialization is legal since p1 is pointer to const int we will not be able to change the value it points to and thus change i2's value.
f)Not legal,needs to be assigned with a value.
g)Legal if i is int because the first part of the declaration just points that i2 is const and the second part means that r is a const refrence that is initialized with value so the initialization is legal.

Exercise 2.28: Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal.
(a) int i, *const cp;
(b) int *p1, *const p2;
(c) const int ic, &r = ic;
(d) const int *const p3;
(e) const int *p

Answers:
a)int i initializes an integer and the second part tries to initialize a const pointer to int without a value and thus is not legal.
b)int *p1 initializes a pointer to int which can be initialized without a value and the second part tries to  initalize a const pointer to int without a value and thus is not legal.
c)const int ic tries to initialize a const int without a value and thus is illegal.
d)Illegal since trying to initiliaze p3 which is a const pointer to const int with out a value, has to be assigned in the declaration.
e)Declaration of pointer p which point to const int.

Exercise 2.29: Uing the variables in the previous exercise, which of the
following assignments are legal? Explain why

(a) i = ic;
(b) p1 = p3;
(c) p1 = &ic;
(d) p3 = &ic;
(e) p2 = p1;
(f) ic = *p3;

Answers:
a)If declaration legal then the assignment will be legal since ic is const int and i is int and can be changed.
b)Not legal there is low-level const mismatch.
c)Not legal there is low-level const mismatch.
d)Not legal since p3 is const pointer to const and thus cannot be assigned.
e)Not legal since p2 is const pointer to const and thus cannot be assigned.
f)Not legal since ic is const int and thus cannot be changed.
