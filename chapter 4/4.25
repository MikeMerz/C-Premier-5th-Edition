Exercise 4.25: What is the value of ~'q' << 6 on a machine with 32-bit
ints and 8 bit chars, that uses Latin-1 character set in which 'q' has the
bit pattern 01110001?

Answer:
q will change to 00000000 00000000 00000000 01110001
so ~q wil result:
11111111 11111111 11111111 10001110
and shifting by 6 will result in:
11111111 11111111 11100011 10000000
