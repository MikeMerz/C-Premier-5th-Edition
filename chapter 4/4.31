Exercise 4.31: The program in this section used the prefix increment and
decrement operators. Explain why we used prefix and not postfix. What
changes would have to be made to use the postfix versions? Rewrite the
program using postfix operators

Answer:
Chose to use prefix since we don't want to create a copy of both ix and cnt each time the loop iterates, changing to postfix wouldn't change the result.


vector<int>::size_type cnt = ivec.size();

for(vector<int>::size_type ix = 0;
ix != ivec.size(); ix++, cnt--)
{
ivec[ix] = cnt;

}
