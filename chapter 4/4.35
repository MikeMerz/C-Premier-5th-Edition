Exercise 4.35: Given the following definitions,

char cval; 
int ival; 
unsigned int ui;
float fval;
double dval;

identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:
(a) cval = 'a' + 3;
(b) fval = ui - ival * 1.0;
(c) dval = ui * fval;
(d) cval = ival + fval + dval;

Answer:
a)'a' is converted to int and the result of the addition is converted to char.
b)ival is converted to double then after the multiplication ui is converted to double and the result converted to float.
c)ui will be converted to float and the result to double.
d)ival will be converted to float and after the addition ival+fval will be converted to double and then the result will be converted to int and then char.
