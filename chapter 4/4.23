Exercise 4.23: The following expression fails to compile due to operator
precedence. Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), explain why it fails. How would you
fix it?

string s = "word";
string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s" ;

Answer:
Since unary plus has higher precedence than the conditional operator so we get left operand of type string and right operand of type char, we can fix this
by adding parentheses : string pl = s + (s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s" );
