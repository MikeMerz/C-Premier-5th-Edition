Exercise 4.22: Extend the program that assigned high pass, pass, and fail
grades to also assign low pass for grades between 60 and 75 inclusive. Write
two versions: One version that uses only conditional operators; the other
should use one or more if statements. Which version do you think is easier
to understand and why?

Answer:
finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass"
: (grade < 60) ? "fail" : (grade < 75) ? "low pass" : "pass";

if(grade > 90)
{
  finalgrade = "high pass";
}
else if(grade < 60)
{
  finalgrade = "fail";
}
else if(grade < 75)
{
  finalgrade = "low pass";
}
else
{
  finalgrade = "pass";
}


I think that the first option is more easier to understand since it provides a netural flow.
