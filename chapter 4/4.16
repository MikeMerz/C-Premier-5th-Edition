Exercise 4.16: Although the following are legal, they probably do not
behave as the programmer expects. Why? Rewrite the expressions as you
think they should be.
(a) if (p = getPtr() != 0)
(b) if (i = 1024)

Answer:
a)Since = has lower precedence than rational operand the expression getPtr() != 0 will be evaluated first and then p will hold either true or false while the
programmer expected p to hold the pointer, the fix will be : if((p = getPtr()) != 0)
b)The condition will alywas yield true since we assign 1024 to i and it's nonzero value , if(i == 1024)
