Exercise 4.29: Predict the output of the following code and explain your
reasoning. Now run the program. Is the output what you expected? If not,
figure out why.

int x[10]; int *p = x;
cout << sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x) << endl;
cout << sizeof(p)/sizeof(*p) << endl;

Answer:
The program will print:
10
2

At first sizeof(x) will return 40 since the array holds 10 ints when each int is 4 and sizeof(*x) will return 4 since it returns the size of the type that the array holds
and sizeof(p) will return 8 since it is the size of a pointer and sizeof(*p) will return 4 since p points to an int and hence we will get 40/4=10 and 8/4=2.
