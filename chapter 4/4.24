Exercise 4.24: Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass,
and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right
associative. Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator
were left associative.

Answer:
If the operator were left asscoative than the expression would be evaluated as:

(grade > 90 ? "high pass" : grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";

which means that if grade > 90 than "high pass" will be returned and evaluated for ? operator and since it's not empty string "fail" will be returned
and if grade < 90 than grade < 60 will be evaluated and return "fail" for true and "pass" otherwise.
