Exercise 4.8: Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND, logical
OR, and equality operators.

Answer:
With the logical AND,OR the left operand is evaluated first and only if it doesn't determine the result will the right operand be evaluated.
The equality operator evaluated both the left and right operands and then it compares the results, however the oreder of the evaluation is undefined.
