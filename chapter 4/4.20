Exercise 4.20: Assuming that iter is a vector<string>::iterator,
indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the
behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error.
(a) *iter++;
(b) (*iter)++;
(c) *iter.empty()
(d) iter->empty();
(e) ++*iter;
(f) iter++->empty();

Answer:
a)Expression is legal and will result in the letter that the unincremented version of iter points to and wont change the string.
b)Expression is legal and will increment one to the letter that iter points to and will change the string.
c)Expression is not legal since iter has no member named empty.
d)Expression is not legal since iter points to a char member which doesn't have member named empty.
e)Expression is legal and will result in the letter that iter points to changing to the next letter.
f)Expression is not legal since iter points to a char and the -> operand will derefrence iter we will get a char which doesn't have member named empty.
