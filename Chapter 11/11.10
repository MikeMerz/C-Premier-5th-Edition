Exercise 11.10: Could we define a map from vector<int>::iterator to
int? What about from list<int>::iterator to int? In each case, if
not, why not?

Answer:
It is possible to define a map from vector's iterator and from lists iterator.
It is possible to use the map that is defined by the vectors iterator since it has < operator,
however it is not possible to use the map that is defined with list since that iterator doesn't have
the < operator implemented.
