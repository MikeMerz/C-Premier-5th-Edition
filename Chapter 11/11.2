Exercise 11.2: Give an example of when each of list, vector, deque,
map, and set might be most useful.

Answer:
set - for example keeping track after specific words that we have seen at least once.

map - for example, a dictionary that each word is a key and the definition is the value.

vector - for example, when a dynamic array is needed.

deque - for example, keeping track for answers of the OS.
