Exercise 6.24: Explain the behavior of the following function. If there are
problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them.

void print(const int ia[10])
{
for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
cout << ia[i] << endl;
}

Answer:
The compiler will translate the parameter of print to const int *ia so it will accept arrays of any length, it could be fixed by adding
a size parameter and iterating for that amount of times so the change will be:
void print(const int ia[10]) -> void print(const int ia[10],size_t size)
and
for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i) -> for (size_t i = 0; i != size; ++i)
