Exercise 6.37: Write three additional declarations for the function in the
previous exercise. One should use a type alias, one should use a trailing
return, and the third should use decltype. Which form do you prefer and
why?

Answer:
trailing return:
auto str() -> string(&)[10];

decltype:
string s = {"1","2","3","4","1","2","3","4","9","10"}
decltype(s) &arrRef(){};

type alias:
typedef string arrtS[10];
arrS& str();

I prefer the trailing version since in my opinion it's the easisest one to understand.
