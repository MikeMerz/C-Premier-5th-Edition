Exercise 6.12: Rewrite the program from exercise 6.10 in ยง 6.2.1 (p. 210)
to use references instead of pointers to swap the value of two ints. Which
version do you think would be easier to use and why?

Answer:
#include <iostream>

void swap(int &a, int &b)
{
  int temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}

int main()
{
  int a = 2;
  int b = 3;
  swap(a, b);
  std::cout<< "a is: "<< a <<std::endl;
  std::cout<< "b is: "<< b <<std::endl;
  return 0;
}

I think using refrence helps the readability of the code, in understanding the purpose of the function better and easier to use the function.
