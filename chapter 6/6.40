Exercise 6.40: Which, if either, of the following declarations are errors?
Why?
(a) int ff(int a, int b = 0, int c = 0);
(b) char *init(int ht = 24, int wd, char bckgrnd);

Answer:
a)Is not an error since all the default are of the same type and are located right to the first default parameter.
b)Declaration is not legal since the first parameter is default and the ones right after it are not.
