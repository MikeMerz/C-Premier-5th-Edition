Exercise 6.39: Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of
the following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.
(a) int calc(int, int);
int calc(const int, const int);

(b) int get();
double get();

(c) int *reset(int *);
double *reset(double *);

Answer:
a)The second declaration is the same the first one since top level const is ignored.

b)The second declaration is not legal since both declarations have the same name and same parameters and are only different in
their return type.

c)The second declaration defines an overload to reset.
