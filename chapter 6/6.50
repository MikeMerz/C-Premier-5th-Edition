Exercise 6.50: Given the declarations for f from page 242, list the viable
functions, if any for each of the following calls. Indicate which function is the
best match, or if the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the call
is ambiguous.
(a) f(2.56, 42)
(b) f(42)
(c) f(42, 0)
(d) f(2.56, 3.14)

Answer:
a)The call is ambiguous since we have two function that are both viable but we don't have a best match function since eatch paratemter
is best match for a different function, one for f(double, double) and the other is for f(int,int).

b)There is only two viable functions,f(int) and f(double, double=3.14) and the best match is f(int).

c)There are two viable function, f(double, double = 3.14) and f(int,int) and the best match is f(int, int).

d)There are two viable function, both f(int, int) and f(double, double) and since both parameters are double the exact match is f(double,double).
