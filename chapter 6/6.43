Exercise 6.43: Which one of the following declarations and definitions would
you put in a header? In a source file? Explain why.
(a) inline bool eq(const BigInt&, const BigInt&) {...}

(b) void putValues(int *arr, int size);

Answer:
a)I would put both the declaration and definition in the header file since it is inlined.
