Exercise 6.13: Assuming T is the name of a type, explain the difference
between a function declared as void f(T) and void f(T&).

Answet:
Function that is declared with f(T) passes a copy of an object of type T and any changes will be on the local copy of T while the declaration f(T&) passes the object of
type T itself and any changes will affect the same object that was passed.
