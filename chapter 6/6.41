Exercise 6.41: Which, if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why? Which,
if any, are legal but unlikely to match the programmerâ€™s intent? Why?

char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');
(a) init();
(b) init(24,10);
(c) init(14, '*');

Answer:
a)The call is not legal since ht is not a default parameter and a value must be provided.
b)Call is legal.
c)Call is legal howver the first parameter will be applied to ht and the char '*' will be converted to an int
and applied to wd, which is probably not what the programer intened since he passed a char he probably wanted it to
override bckgrnd.
