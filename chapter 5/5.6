Exercise 5.6: Rewrite your grading program to use the conditional operator
(§ 4.7, p. 151) in place of the if–else statement.

Answer:

  const std::vector<std::string> scores = { "F", "D", "C", "B", "A", "A++"};
  std::string lettergrade;
  int grade;
  std::cin >> grade;
  lettergrade = grade >= 60 ? scores[(grade - 50) / 10] : scores[0]
