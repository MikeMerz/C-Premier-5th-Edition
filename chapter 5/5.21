Exercise 5.21: Revise the program from the exercise in ยง 5.5.1 (p. 191) so
that it looks only for duplicated words that start with an uppercase letter.

Answer:
 std::string last, cur;
 bool success = false;
 while (std::cin >> cur)
   {
   if(!isupper(cur[0]))
   continue;
    if(cur == last)
    {
    std::cout<<cur;
    success = true;
    break;
    }
    else
    {
    last = cur;
    }
   }
   if(!success)
   std::cout<<"No duplicate found";
