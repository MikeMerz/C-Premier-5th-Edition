Exercise 5.3: Use the comma operator (ยง 4.10, p. 157) to rewrite the
while loop from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 11) so that it no longer requires a block. Explain
whether this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this code

Answer:
while(val <=10 && (sum+=val,++val));

In my opinion the rewrite diminishes the readability of the code since it's harder to understand the main idea of the loop.
