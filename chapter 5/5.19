Exercise 5.19: Write a program that uses a do while loop to repetitively
request two strings from the user and report which string is less than
the other.

Answer:
  std::string s1, s2;
  std::cin >> s1 >> s2;
  do
  {
    std::cout << s1 == s2 ? "Equal" : s1 < s2 ? "First" : "Second";
  }
  while(std::cin >> s1 >> s2)
