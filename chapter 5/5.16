Exercise 5.16: The while loop is particularly good at executing while some
condition holds; for example, when we need to read values until end-of-file.
The for loop is generally thought of as a step loop: An index steps through
a range of values in a collection. Write an idiomatic use of each loop and
then rewrite each using the other loop construct. If you could use only one
loop, which would you choose? Why?

Answer:
  int i;
  while (std::cin >> i) { /* ... */ }
  for (int j; std::cin >> j;) { /* ... */ }
  
  I would choose while loops since while loop can imitate a for loop and it adds the option to iterate for an unknown number of elements.
