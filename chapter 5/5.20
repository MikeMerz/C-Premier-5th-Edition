Exercise 5.20: Write a program to read a sequence of strings from the
standard input until either the same word occurs twice in succession or all
the words have been read. Use a while loop to read the text one word at a
time. Use the break statement to terminate the loop if a word occurs twice
in succession. Print the word if it occurs twice in succession, or else print a
message saying that no word was repeated.

Answer:
 std::string last, cur;
 bool success = false;
 while (std::cin >> cur)
   {
    if(cur == last)
    {
    std::cout<<cur;
    success = true;
    break;
    }
    else
    {
    last = cur;
    }
   }
   if(!success)
   std::cout<<"No duplicate found";
