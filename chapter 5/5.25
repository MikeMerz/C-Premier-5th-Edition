Exercise 5.25: Revise your program from the previous exercise to use a
try block to catch the exception. The catch clause should print a message
to the user and ask them to supply a new number and repeat the code inside
the try.

Answer:
int first,sec;
while(true)
{
std::cin >> first>>sec;
try
{
if(sec == 0)
{
  throw runtime_error("Division by zero);
}
return first/sec;
}
catch(runtime_error &e)
{
  std::cout<<"Division by 0 has occured, Please supply two numbers";
}
}
