Exercise 5.10: There is one problem with our vowel-counting program as
we’ve implemented it: It doesn’t count capital letters as vowels. Write a
program that counts both lower- and uppercase letters as the appropriate
vowel—that is, your program should count both 'a' and 'A' as part of
aCnt, and so forth

Answer:
unsigned aCnt = 0, eCnt = 0, iCnt = 0, oCnt = 0, uCnt = 0;
char ch;
while (cin >> ch) {
// if ch is a vowel, increment the appropriate counter
ch = tolower(ch);
if(ch == 'a')
++aCnt;
else if(ch == 'e')
++eCnt;
else if(ch == 'i')
++iCnt;
else if(ch == 'o')
++oCnt;
else if(ch == 'u')
++uCnt;
}
