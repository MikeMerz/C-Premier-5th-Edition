Exercise 3.19: List three ways to define a vector and give it ten elements,
each with the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so
and why.

Answer:
First way : std::vector<int> temp(10, 42)
Second way: std::vector<int> temp{42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42, 42}.
Third way: std::vecor<int> temp; 
for(int i=0; i < 10; ++i)
{
  temp.push_back(42);
}

Since we know the size and values that are needed for the vector both the first and second way are preffered however the first way is more readable and thus it is
the most preferred way.
