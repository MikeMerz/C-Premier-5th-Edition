Exercise 7.5: Provide operations in your Person class to return the name
and address. Should these functions be const? Explain your choice.

Answer:
class Person
{
  std::string getName() const {return name;}
  std::string getAddress() const {return address;}
  
  std::string name;
  std::string address;
}

The functions should be const since they don't change the object on which they are called but only used to retrieve data from it.
