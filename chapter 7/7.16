Exercise 7.16: What, if any, are the constraints on where and how often an
access specifier may appear inside a class definition? What kinds of members
should be defined after a public specifier? What kinds should be private?

Answer:

There are no constaints on where or how often an acces specifier may appear, we would like that members
who are part of the API will be public and that members part of the implementation will be private.
