//Exercise 7.46: Which, if any, of the following statements are untrue? Why?
//(a) A class must provide at least one constructor.
//(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
//(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not
//provide a default constructor.
//(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates
//one that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated
//type.

/*
 * Answer:
 * The statements that are not true are:
 *
 * b --> A default constructor is a constructor with an empty or only default value parameter list.
 * c --> If the class hold members that can be default initiated then the symthesized constucor that the compiler will add will be enough in order to initliaze it, if not
 * then we will need to add a constructor in which we will initalize the members;
 * d --> The compiler will generate a default constructor only for classes that has no constructors at all.
