//Exercise 7.47: Explain whether the Sales_data constructor that takes a
//string should be explicit. What are the benefits of making the
//constructor explicit? What are the drawbacks?

/*
 * Answer:
 * That constructor should be explicit since calling combine with a Sales_data object and astring doesn't have any logical
 * meaning.
 * Drawback is that we must call the constructor explicity.
 * Benefit is that using explicit will help the logic of our program.
