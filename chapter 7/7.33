Exercise 7.33: What would happen if we gave Screen a size member
defined as follows? Fix any problems you identify.

pos Screen::size() const
{
 return height * width;
}

Answer:
Outside of the class Screen scope pos will not be recognized and thus the program will not compile, we need to add 
the scope of the pos definition for the program to compile, so changing to Screen::pos will fix the issue.
