//Exercise 7.42: For the class you wrote for exercise 7.40 in § 7.5.1 (p. 291),
//decide whether any of the constructors might use delegation. If so, write the
//delegating constructor(s) for your class. If not, look at the list of abstractions
//and choose one that you think would use a delegating constructor. Write the
//class definition for that abstraction.
