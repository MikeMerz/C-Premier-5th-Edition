Exercise 7.39: Would it be legal for both the constructor that takes a
string and the one that takes an istream& to have default arguments? If
not, why not?
 Answer:
 No, since a contructor that has only default parameters is considered the default constructor so if both will
 have only default constructors they both will be considered as default so calling them will be ambiguios.
