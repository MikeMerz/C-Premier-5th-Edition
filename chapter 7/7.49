//Exercise 7.49: For each of the three following declarations of combine,
//explain what happens if we call i.combine(s), where i is a Sales_data
//and s is a string:
//(a) Sales_data &combine(Sales_data);
//(b) Sales_data &combine(Sales_data&);
//(c) Sales_data &combine(const Sales_data&) const;

/*
 * Answer:
 * a) First a call to Sales_data(string) then call for combine.
 * b) First a call to Sales_data(string) which will create temporary Sales_data and passing a refrence to it will cause undefined behaviour.
 * c) The program will not compile since adding const to combine will prevent us from changing the state of Sales_data and thus we won't be able to perform the addition.
