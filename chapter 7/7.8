Exercise 7.8: Why does read define its Sales_data parameter as a plain
reference and print define its parameter as a reference to const?

Answer:
read defines its Sales_data parameter as a plain refrence because of the line : item.revenue = price * item.units_sold; which changes the value of revenue,
meanwhile print doesn't change any members.
