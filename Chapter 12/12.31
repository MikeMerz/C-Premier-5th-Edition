Exercise 12.31: What difference(s) would it make if we used a vector
instead of a set to hold the line numbers? Which approach is better? Why?

Answer:
changing the set to a vector would cause us to have duplicates if the line contains multiple occurences of the same word
and the runtime for checking duplicated would be higher.

The set approach is better since it doesn't matter how many times we have seen the same word on the same line we need
to keep track of unique lines.
