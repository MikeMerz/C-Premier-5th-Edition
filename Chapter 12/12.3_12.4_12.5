Exercise 12.3: Does this class need const versions of push_back and
pop_back? If so, add them. If not, why aren’t they needed?

Answer:
The const versions of pop_back and push_back are not needed since they don't modify any data.

Exercise 12.4: In our check function we didn’t check whether i was
greater than zero. Why is it okay to omit that check?

Answer:
Since the type of i is size_t which is unsigned it will be converted to a non-negative number.

Exercise 12.5: We did not make the constructor that takes an
initializer_list explicit (§ 7.5.4, p. 296). Discuss the pros and
cons of this design choice.

Answer:
Pros:
The compiler will not use that constructor implicity.

Cons:
Each time a temporary StrBlob will be created.
