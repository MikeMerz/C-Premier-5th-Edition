Exercise 10.38: List the five iterator categories and the operations that each
supports.

Answer:

1)Input Iterators supports:
    * Prefix and postfix increment(++) in order to advance the iterator.
    * Dereference  operator in order to read an element, may appear only on right side of assignment.
    * Equality and inequality operators (!=, ==)
    * Arrow operator(->) in order to Dereference and fetch a member from the object.
    * A one pass iterator.

2)Forward Iterators -
    * Prefix and postfix increment(++) in order to advance the iterator.
    * Dereference operator in order to read an element, may appear on right side of assignment.
    * Arrow operator(->) in order to Dereference and fetch a member from the object.
    * Equality and inequality operators (!=,==)
    * Dereference  operator in order to read an element, may appear on left side of assignment.
    * One pass iterator.

3)Bidirectional Iterators, same as Forward Iterators but can reverse -
    * Prefix and postfix increment(++) in order to advance the iterator.
    * Dereference operator in order to read an element, may appear on right side of assignment.
    * Arrow operator(->) in order to Dereference and fetch a member from the object.
    * Equality and inequality operators (!=,==)
    * Dereference  operator in order to read an element, may appear on left side of assignment.
    * Prefix and postfix decrement(--) in order to reverse the iterator.

4)Output Iterators -
    * Dereference  operator in order to read an element, may appear only on left side of assignment.
    * Prefix and postfix increment(++) in order to advance the iterator.

5)Random-access Iterators, support all as Bidirectional and -
    * Rational operators (<,>,>=,<=).
    * Subtraction operator(-), which returns the distance between two iterators.
    * Random-access operator([n]), which is equvilant to *(iter + n).
    * Addition of subtraction operators(+=,-=,+,-) that when applied on an iterator and integral value
      moves the iterator forward or backwards the integral amount of elements.
