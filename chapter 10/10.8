Exercise 10.8: We said that algorithms do not change the size of the
containers over which they operate. Why doesnâ€™t the use of back_inserter
invalidate this claim?

Answer:
The algorithm itself doesn't change that size of the container it operates on but the back_inserter only inserts
elements to the a different container and doesn't effect the first container.
