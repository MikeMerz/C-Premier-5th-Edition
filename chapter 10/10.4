Exercise 10.4: Assuming v is a vector<double>, what, if anything, is
wrong with calling accumulate(v.cbegin(), v.cend(), 0)?

Answer:
Since 0 will be treated as an int and the has double type, the program will still compile
but the result will be truncated to an int and this will cause us to lose the percision.
