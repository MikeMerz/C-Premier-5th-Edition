Exercise 10.10: Why do you think the algorithms donâ€™t change the size of
containers?

Answer:
In my opinion it is because algorithms work with iterators so changing the size of the container might
invalidate the iterators or reallocate the members which will hurt performance, in addition that way the
algorithm is not depended on the container it operates on since different containers may have
different methods of adding or removing elements.
