Exercise 10.7: Determine if there are any errors in the following programs
and, if so, correct the error(s):

(a)
vector<int> vec;
list<int> lst;
int i;
while (cin >> i)
    lst.push_back(i);
copy(lst.cbegin(), lst.cend(), vec.begin());

Answer:
Will produce an error since copy assumes that vec will have enough memory to copy the elements how ever vec is empty and thus we
will get undefined behaviour.

(b)
vector<int> vec;
vec.reserve(10); // reserve is covered in ยง 9.4 (p. 356)
fill_n(vec.begin(), 10, 0);

Answer:
No problem, vec reserves enough memory for 10 ints and fill_n will fill those 10 elements with the value 0.
